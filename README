// A simple module to add a localstorage cache to `Backbone.sync`.
// objects you have already fetched are retrieved from the local
// cache. If there isn't a cache, it falls back to 'Backbine.sync'
// which does not need to be the default implementation

// to use, extend Backbone.CachedModel instead of Backbone.Model
// for your models. Ensure you define a unique 'cacheName' for each
// model
