A simple module to add a localstorage cache to `Backbone.sync`.
Objects you have already fetched are retrieved from the local
cache. If there isn't a cache, it falls back to 'Backbine.sync'
which does not need to be the default implementation

To use, extend Backbone.CachedModel instead of Backbone.Model
for your models. Ensure you define a unique 'cacheName' for each
model

example ussage:
var User = Backbone.CachedModel.extend({
  cacheName: 'USERS',
});
